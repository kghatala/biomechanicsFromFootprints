## Understanding biomechanics from footprints

This repository contains the R code that I used for statistical analyses presented in the paper "Interpreting locomotor biomechanics from the morphology of human footprints" published in the Journal of Human Evolution and available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284156572_Interpreting_locomotor_biomechanics_from_the_morphology_of_human_footprints). 

In this paper, we present results from a series of biomechanical experiments that were designed to examine how locomotor mechanics influence footprint morphology as people traverse deformable substrates. The ultimate goal of this (and related studies) was to develop new methods for inferring the locomotor mechanics of extinct human fossil relatives from 1.5 million year old footprints that we have discovered and excavated in Kenya.
