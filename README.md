## Understanding biomechanics from footprints

This repository contains the R code that I used for statistical analyses presented in the paper "Interpreting locomotor biomechanics from the morphology of human footprints" published in the Journal of Human Evolution and available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284156572_Interpreting_locomotor_biomechanics_from_the_morphology_of_human_footprints). 

In this paper, we present results from a series of biomechanical experiments that were designed to examine how locomotor mechanics influence footprint morphology as people walk and run across deformable substrates. The ultimate goal of this (and related studies) was to develop new methods for inferring locomotor mechanics (and evolutionary implications) from 1.5 million year old footprints of fossil human relatives that we have discovered and excavated in Kenya.
